              I completed a comprehensive MERN stack development program from
              Programming Hero from 2023 to 2024. This immersive course covered
              MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, providing a solid
              foundation in full-stack web development. Through hands-on
              projects and real-world applications, I honed my skills in
              building responsive, dynamic, and scalable web applications. The
              program emphasized modern development practices, including RESTful
              APIs, authentication, and state management. I also gained
              experience with version control, deployment, and debugging. This
              training has equipped me with the knowledge and confidence to
              create robust web solutions, and I am eager to contribute to
              innovative projects in the tech industry.
